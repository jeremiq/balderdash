# Balderdash!
This is a simple python3 script for building vocabulary and playing the
word game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balderdash"
target="_blank">Balderdash</a>.

It uses the <a href="http://developer.wordnik.com/"
target="_blank">wordnik</a> API to find words and definitions.

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/jeremiq/balderdash.git
cd balderdash
pip install wordnik-py3==2.1.2
```

 This script is also runable on with python 2.x. You must install `wordnik==2.1.3`, though.
# Run

``` bash
./balderdash.py
```

or

```
python3 balderdash.py
```

Use the 'n' key to get more words and definitions and 'q' to quit.
